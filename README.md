## Project: Simple Book Class

This simple C# project contains:
- `Book.cs` : Definition of the Book class with private member variables, properties, empty and parameterized constructors, a member function (UpdateYear) and ToString() override.
- `Program.cs` : Contains Main method. Creates Book objects, modifies them, stores them in an array, and prints the results.

## How to run
1. Create a new console project or use dotnet CLI:
   - Replace Program.cs and add Book.cs into the project folder.
  

2. Or open the files in Visual Studio and run the project.

## Notes
- Only .cs files and this README should be uploaded to the course GitHub repository.
- This implementation meets the assignment requirements: at least two member variables, properties, an empty constructor, a parameterized constructor, at least one member function, ToString override, and Main uses class objects.
